# WhatTheFlora!
She Hacks 2024 

## Introduction

WhatTheFlora is a mobile app developed to identify and log information about wild edible plants. With each plant, you unlock more of your FloraDex and further your journey to become the Flora Master.

## Features 📚
Our application includes:
- Extraction of plant data
- A camera that allows us to proceed to the plant recognition stage
- Ineractive user interface to enhance overall user experience

## Getting Started 🏁

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WhatTheFlora.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Setup the react native:
    ```bash
    npm install -g react-native-cli

4. Access the application by setting up expo environment
    ```bash
    npx expo start

## Usage 🧐

Allows a user to take a picture of any edible flora they encounter, and then using its image recognition will let the user know the identify of the plant as well as various information about the flora. Once a flora is identified, it will be logged for the user, effectively saving it in their FloraDex.
